= Micronaut AWS API Gateway Proxy Starter Project

Lambda for API Gateway Proxy is defined in `:hello-world` subproject and can be deployed with `./gradlew :hello-world:deployLambda` command.

Local server is defined in `:local-server` subproject and can be run with `./gradlew :local-server:run` command.

Both projects contain tests using https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/[Gru].

To add new lambda, copy the `:hello-world` project and add the new subproject to `settings.gradle` and as a dependency of `:local-server`
